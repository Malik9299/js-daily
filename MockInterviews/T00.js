// Question: 1
// What is Hoisting
// Answer

// Hoisting in JavaScript is a behavior in which variable and function declarations are moved, or "hoisted," to the top of their containing scope (either global or function scope) before code execution. This means that you can use variables and functions before they are declared in the code, without getting a reference error.
