// Prime numbers are natural numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves. In other words, a prime number is a number that cannot be formed by multiplying two smaller natural numbers.
// Properties of Prime Numbers:

// 1- Divisibility: A prime number has exactly two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself.
// 2- Uniqueness: Every natural number greater than 1 is either a prime or can be factored into primes (this is the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic).

// Examples of Prime Numbers:
// The first few prime numbers are:

// 2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31,37,41,43,47,53,59,61,67,71,73,79,83,89,97,â€¦

// Interesting Facts:

// 2 is the only even prime number. All other even numbers can be divided by 2, so they are not prime.
// Prime numbers become less frequent as numbers get larger, but there are infinitely many prime numbers. This was proven by Euclid around 300 BC.

// Applications of Prime Numbers:

// 1. Cryptography: Prime numbers are fundamental in various encryption algorithms, including RSA encryption, which is widely used for secure data transmission.
// 2. Computer Algorithms: Many algorithms in computer science use prime numbers for hashing, random number generation, and other purposes.
// 3. Number Theory: Prime numbers are central to many problems and theorems in number theory, a branch of pure mathematics.
