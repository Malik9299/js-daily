<!-- ### React JS Concepts

1.  JSX (JavaScript XML) - A syntax extension for JavaScript that looks similar to HTML. It allows you to write UI components in a declarative way.

2.  :white_check_mark: Components

    1. :white_check_mark: Functional Components
    2. :white_check_mark: Class Components

3.  :white_check_mark: Props (Properties) - Read-only attributes passed from parent to child components to configure or pass data.

4.  :white_check_mark: State - A built-in React object used to store data that changes over time and influences what is rendered.

5.  :white_check_mark: [React batches state updates](https://react.dev/learn/queueing-a-series-of-state-updates)

6.  Lifecycle Methods - Methods available in class components that allow you to run code at specific points in a component's life cycle (e.g., componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, componentWillUnmount). [@tjholowaychuk]

7.  Hooks

    1. :white_check_mark: useState
    2. :white_check_mark: useEffect
    3. useContext
    4. useReducer
    5. useMemo
    6. useCallback
    7. useRef

8.  Context API - A way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.

9.  Refs - A way to directly interact with DOM elements or store a value that persists between renders.

10. Controlled vs. Uncontrolled Components - Controlled Components: Form elements whose value is controlled by React state. - Uncontrolled Components: Form elements that maintain their own internal state.

11. Keys - Special string attributes used in lists to help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed.

12. Portals -A way to render children into a DOM node outside the parent component hierarchy.

13. Error Boundaries -Components that catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child component tree and display a fallback UI instead of crashing the whole tree.

14. :white_check_mark: Fragments - A way to group a list of children without adding extra nodes to the DOM.

15. Higher-Order Components (HOCs) -A pattern used to enhance components by wrapping them in another component.

16. Render Props - A technique for sharing code between components using a prop whose value is a function.

17. PropTypes - A way to check the types of props passed to a component to ensure they are correct.

18. Memoization - React.memo: A higher-order component that memoizes a component to prevent unnecessary re-renders. - useMemo and useCallback: Hooks used to memoize values and functions, respectively.

19. Server-Side Rendering (SSR) - Rendering React components on the server before sending HTML to the client.

20. Static Site Generation (SSG) - Pre-rendering pages at build time, typically used with frameworks like Next.js.

21. Code Splitting - A technique to split code into smaller bundles that can be loaded on demand, improving performance.

22. Lazy Loading - Dynamically importing components or modules only when they are needed.

23. Concurrent Mode - A set of new features that help React apps stay responsive and gracefully adjust to the userâ€™s device capabilities and network speed.

24. Suspense - A feature that allows you to display a fallback UI while waiting for some asynchronous operation (like data fetching) to complete.

25. React Fiber - The new reconciliation algorithm in React 16 that enables features like concurrent mode, time slicing, and more.

26. Custom Hooks - Reusable functions that encapsulate logic using built-in hooks to share behavior across components.

27. Context Providers and Consumers - Provider: A component that provides a value to its descendants. - Consumer: A component that subscribes to a context and uses its value.

28. Virtual DOM - An in-memory representation of the actual DOM that React uses to efficiently update the UI.

29. Babel - A JavaScript compiler that converts React JSX code into plain JavaScript.

30. Webpack - A module bundler often used in React projects to bundle JavaScript files for usage in the browser.

31. :white_check_mark: React Router - A library for managing navigation and routing in React applications.

32. Redux - A state management library often used in large React applications to manage global state.

33. Testing in React: - Jest: A testing framework often used with React.
    React Testing Library: A library for testing React components.
    Enzyme: Another popular testing utility for React.

34. :white_check_mark: Component Composition (Composition vs Inheritance): - The practice of combining components to build more complex UIs.

35. Prop Drilling: - Passing props through multiple layers of components, which can lead to complex and difficult-to-maintain code.

36. Styled Components: - A library for styling React components using tagged template literals and CSS-in-JS.

37. React Query: - A library for managing server-state in React, with features for data fetching, caching, synchronization, and more.

38. React Hook Form: - A library for handling form inputs, validations, and submissions using React hooks.

39. :negative_squared_cross_mark: Next.js: - A React framework that provides SSR, SSG, and a range of other features for building web applications.

40. :x: PWA (Progressive Web Apps): - A web application that uses modern web capabilities to provide an app-like experience.

41. React Native: - A framework for building native apps using React.

42. Client side Rendering: .
